# Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) Compliance

## Overview

The Garment Sustainability Bot strives to comply with the Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) framework, which defines comprehensive standards for repository organization, documentation, and development practices.

## RSR Compliance Level: **Bronze**

We currently achieve **Bronze-level** RSR compliance for a Python project.

## Compliance Checklist

- ✅ Automated testing (4 Python versions)
- ✅ Code quality checks (Black, Flake8, MyPy, Pylint)
- ✅ Security scanning (Safety)
- ✅ Build verification

### ✅ Testing (Complete)

- ✅ Unit tests (tests/unit/)
- ✅ Integration tests (tests/integration/)
- ✅ Test coverage tracking (pytest-cov)
- ✅ 100% test pass rate
- ✅ CI/CD integration

### ✅ TPCF (Complete)

- ✅ TPCF.md - Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework declaration
- ✅ Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)
- ✅ Clear contribution model
- ✅ Transparent governance

### ⚠️ Type Safety (Partial - Python Limitation)

- ✅ Type hints in code
- ✅ MyPy type checking in CI
- ⚠️ Not compile-time guaranteed (Python limitation)
- ⚠️ Dynamic typing by language design

**Assessment**: Best effort for Python. Full type safety would require Rust/Ada/ReScript.

### ⚠️ Memory Safety (Partial - Python Limitation)

- ✅ Python's automatic memory management
- ✅ No manual memory management
- ⚠️ Not zero-copy or ownership-based (Python limitation)
- ⚠️ Garbage collection instead of compile-time safety

**Assessment**: Python is memory-safe by design but not in the Rust sense.

### ⚠️ Offline-First (Partial)

- ✅ Core functionality works offline (database, logic)
- ✅ No required network calls for base operations
- ⚠️ Discord bot requires network for Discord API
- ⚠️ Optional external integrations may need network

**Assessment**: Mostly offline-capable except for Discord communication (inherent to bot nature).

### ⚠️ Zero Dependencies (Not Applicable)

- ❌ Has many dependencies (Discord.py, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- ℹ️ Python ecosystem typically uses dependencies
- ℹ️ Dependencies are vetted and security-scanned

**Assessment**: Not zero-dependency. This is acceptable for Bronze level and typical for Python projects.

### ✅ Reproducible Builds (Partial)

- ✅ requirements.txt with version pinning
- ✅ Docker for containerized reproducibility
- ✅ Virtual environments supported
- ⚠️ No Nix flake (could add if needed)

**Assessment**: Reproducible via Docker and pip. Nix would be gold standard.

## RSR Level Definitions

### Bronze Level (Current)

**Required:**
- ✅ All documentation files
- ✅ .well-known/ directory
- ✅ Build system (Justfile or Makefile)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Test suite with >80% coverage
- ✅ TPCF declaration
- ⚠️ Best-effort type safety (for dynamic languages)

**Achieved:** Yes (Bronze compliant for Python)

### Silver Level

**Additional requirements:**
- Formal verification (SPARK, TLA+, or equivalent)
- Zero critical dependencies or all dependencies verified
- Reproducible builds (Nix)
- Multi-language verification
- Security audit

**Status:** Not pursued (Bronze sufficient for this project)

### Gold Level

**Additional requirements:**
- Complete formal verification
- Zero dependencies
- Mathematical proofs of correctness
- Security certification
- Academic peer review

**Status:** Not applicable (research-grade requirements)

## Compliance by Category

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | 7 core docs + 3 .well-known |
| Build System | ✅ Complete | Justfile + Makefile |
| CI/CD | ✅ Complete | GitHub Actions, 4 Python versions |
| Testing | ✅ Complete | Unit + integration, >80% coverage |
| TPCF | ✅ Complete | Perimeter 3 declared |
| Type Safety | ⚠️ Partial | Python type hints + MyPy |
| Memory Safety | ⚠️ N/A | Python is memory-safe by design |
| Offline-First | ⚠️ Partial | Core logic offline, Discord needs network |
| Zero Deps | ❌ No | 25+ dependencies (typical for Python) |
| Reproducible | ✅ Complete | Docker + pip freeze |

## Verification

Run RSR compliance check:

```bash
just rsr-check
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Check documentation
ls -la *.md .well-known/

# Check build system
ls -la Justfile Makefile setup.py

# Check tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Check CI/CD
cat .github/workflows/main.yml
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Immediate Priorities

- ✅ All Bronze requirements met

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Add Nix flake for Nix users
- [ ] Increase type hint coverage to 100%
- [ ] Add more integration tests
- [ ] Consider TLA+ specs for distributed logic (CRDTs)
- [ ] Add security audit
- [ ] Explore formal verification for critical paths

### Not Planned

- Zero dependencies (impractical for Python ecosystem)
- Full formal verification (not needed for this use case)
- Memory safety proofs (Python handles this)

## RSR Benefits

### For Contributors

- **Clear structure**: Know where to find things
- **Standards compliance**: Familiar patterns
- **Quality signals**: High-quality project indicators
- **Documentation**: Everything is documented

### For Users

- **Trust**: Well-documented, tested, reviewed
- **Security**: Security policy and scanning
- **Transparency**: Open processes and governance
- **Support**: Clear channels for help

### For Maintainers

- **Best practices**: Framework for organization
- **Consistency**: Standard structure across projects
- **Automation**: CI/CD and tooling
- **Governance**: Clear decision-making processes

## Relationship to Other Standards

### RSR vs. Other Standards

- **RSR**: Comprehensive repository standards
- **REUSE**: License compliance (complementary)
- **OpenSSF**: Security best practices (overlap)
- **CII Best Practices**: Security and development (overlap)

### Integration

RSR integrates well with:
- OpenSSF Best Practices Badge
- REUSE compliance
- CII Badge criteria
- GitHub's Security features

## Tools and Automation

### Compliance Checking

```bash
# Run RSR compliance check
just rsr-check

# Run all validation
just validate

# Check specific aspects
just test        # Testing compliance
just lint        # Code quality compliance
just security    # Security compliance
```

### Continuous Compliance

CI/CD pipeline ensures:
- Tests always pass
- Code quality maintained
- Security scanned
- Documentation updated

## Exceptions and Adaptations

### Python-Specific Adaptations

1. **Type Safety**: Python uses type hints, not compile-time types
2. **Memory Safety**: Python is garbage-collected, not ownership-based
3. **Dependencies**: Python ecosystem relies on packages
4. **Build System**: pip/setuptools instead of Cargo/Cabal

These are acceptable adaptations for Bronze-level compliance in Python.

### Discord Bot Specific

1. **Offline-First**: Bot needs Discord API (network required)
2. **Real-time**: Interactive commands require connectivity

These are inherent to the bot's purpose and documented.
